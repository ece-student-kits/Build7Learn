I\'ve served as a coordinator and volunteer in various workshops conducted in the college and have hands-on experience with platforms like Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, STM32, 8051, and LoRaWAN. I enjoy exploring new domains and technologies, and I thrive on interacting with people.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### Initiative\\nMy inspiration to create this documentation website came from a site built by friends for a Gen AI Bootcamp using Docusaurus. I was part of the KHACKS community at the time, and their project sparked my passion for building one of my own.\\n\\n### My Team\\n\\n![Docusaurus Plushie](./images/team.jpg)\\n\\n- #### Content Creation:\\n    - Aldrin G\\n    - Kevin\\n\\n- #### Testing & Management:\\n    - Sherin\\n    - Lemeka\\n\\n### Acknolegement\\n\\nI am deeply grateful to my faculty mentors, **Ms. Bella Mary**, **Mr. Johnpaul**, and **Mr. Wilson Cristopher**, for providing me with the opportunity to conduct this workshop for `30 students in the ECE Department`. I also extend my heartfelt thanks to my amazing team\u2014 **Kevin**, **Sherin**, and **Lemeka** whose dedication and support were instrumental in the workshop\'s success. They contributed to content creation, documentation, poster design, form management, attendance tracking, and mentoring throughout the entire session."}]}}')}}]);
